      <h1>Sorting Algorithms</h1>

      <h2>Quicksort</h2>
      <p>
        Quicksort is a fast sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer
        approach. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and
        partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether
        they are less than or greater than the pivot.
      </p>

      <h2>Insertion Sort</h2>
      <p>
        Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final
        sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large
        lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or
        merge sort.
      </p>

      <h2>Radix Sort</h2>
      <p>
        Radix Sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts
        data with integer keys by grouping keys by the individual digits that
        share the same significant position and value. Radix Sort can be applied
        to both integers and strings.
      </p>

      <h2>Heapsort</h2>
      <p>
        Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap
        data structure to build a max-heap (for ascending order) or min-heap
        (for descending order) and then performs a heap-based sorting. It has a
        time complexity of O(n log n) and is not significantly affected by the
        initial ordering of the input.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      After conducting tests, it was observed that Insertion Sort performs
      better for arrays smaller than 100 elements. However, for larger arrays
      exceeding 100 elements, Radix Sort demonstrated better performance. The
      choice of sorting algorithm may depend on the size and characteristics of
      the data set being sorted.
